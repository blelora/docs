# Welcome 
Welcome to BLE LoRa, a project for demonstrating BLE and LoRa capable devices. 
Our aim is to accelerate the development of projects and bring attention to 
this powerful combination of radio technologies. We also hope to create useful
tools and standards for configuring and controlling a LoRa radio over BLE.

# Project Components
This project is made up of three main software components, they are listed below.
### Device Firmware 
There will be example firmware for each supported hardware device that is targeted by the project. The first hardware device is the [RAK4631 WisBlock module](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak4631-lpwan-node), which includes a Nordic nRF52840 MCU with BLE 5.0 paired to the latest LoRaÂ® transceivers from Semtech, the SX126x series.
### CLI Tool
A Command line tool is available to perform firmware updates and configuration over serial.
### Mobile App
A mobile app for Android and iOS is available to demonstrate all the capabilities
of the device.
  
# Getting Started
To get started you will need to flash your hardware with the latest firmware using the 
appropriate CLI tool. Visit the getting started guide for the BLE LoRa CLI utility [here](/docs/cli/getting-started).
